# Spring Boot Microservices with Docker

This project demonstrates microservices architecture with Spring Boot and run it with Docker Compose.

This simple application comprised of:
- Spring Framework (Spring Boot)
- An Authentication using JWT.
- Database (PostgreSQL & MySQL)
- Netflix Zuul for api gateway.
- Eureka Server as service discovery.
- Docker for manage every container with an internal network between the service.

## Getting Started

Assume you already have Docker Compose installed. See https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/.

To install this application, run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/residwi/spring-microservices-docker.git
cd spring-microservices-docker
```

Run the following command to create Docker containers for all your apps.

`./mvnw clean install`

Then you can start the application using Docker Compose:

`docker-compose up -d`

After everything starts, you can open your browser to http://localhost:8888.

## Services

You can check all services that registers to service-discovery at http://localhost:8761

- **api-gateway**: Netflix Zuul. Itâ€™s a proxy, gateway, an intermediate layer between the client and the services.
- **auth-service**: Authentication with JWT for validate the user credentials, generate a token, or throw an exception if not valid user.
- **config-server**: A service for manage a configuration every service.
- **member-service**: A persistence service for manage members.
- **product-service**: A persistence service for manage products.
- **service-discovery**: Eureka Server for service discovery. To automate deployment, so it's easy to scale.

```

## Architecture Design

![Application Architecture](architecture.png)

This architecture is easy to scale because:
- Each service has a specific function or responsibility.
- Each service can use different language stacks.
- Each service has its own database according to their needs.
- Using Docker, so you can scale a container/node e.g `docker-compose scale member=3`
- Have an api gateway, to load balances and routing every request.
- Have a Service Discovery, if you deploy new service it will register itself into the discovery service.
